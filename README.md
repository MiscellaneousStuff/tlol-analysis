# Issues

- Auto attack inference from missiles is unreliable, especially at 16x replay speed.
  - Not all auto attacks are being correctly scraped (probably needs to be 2x or 4x at most :/).
    Or activespell needs to be correctly fixed within T_T-Pandoras-Box. This would be far more reliable
    and allow for much higher throughput.
